# Workshop 1

After you've filled in your solutions inside the `your_solutions` folder, run `make [testname]` from this repository's root directory to check your code.

For example, to test a file called `myCode.py`, run `make myCode`.

(Yes, you can look inside `sample_solutions` and copy the code -- but the point of this is for you to learn! No pain, no gain.)
